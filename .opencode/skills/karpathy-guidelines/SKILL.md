# Karpathy Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, derived from Andrej Karpathy's observations on LLM coding pitfalls.

Tradeoff: These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

Do not assume. Do not hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them instead of choosing silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop, name what is confusing, and ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No flexibility or configurability that was not requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask: would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Do not improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Do not refactor things that are not broken.
- Match existing style, even if you would do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it rather than deleting it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports, variables, or functions that your changes made unused.
- Do not remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

Every changed line should trace directly to the user request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" -> "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" -> "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" -> "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```txt
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
3. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let the agent loop independently. Weak criteria require clarification.
